### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Alessandra!
                                                                                                                                                    
> At the beginning of 2022, I started a Full-stack Web Developer course with Resilia EducaÃ§Ã£o in partnership with Ebanx, where I had my first exposure to the field and gained some knowledge in JavaScript;
> In August 2022, I had the opportunity to participate in a learning program at MadeiraMadeira, which allowed me to delve deeper into the path I wanted to pursue. This experience provided me with a better understanding of the day-to-day life of a developer and tools.;
> Currently, I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at PUCPR while working as an IT Assistant at MadeiraMadeira.
